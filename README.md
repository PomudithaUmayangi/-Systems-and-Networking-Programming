Secure Network Programming Project
This repository contains the implementation and documentation of various tasks related to system and network programming. The project focuses on configuring and managing a secure Linux environment, emphasizing networking protocols, automation, and security best practices.

Project Overview
This project is part of the IE2012 â€“ Systems and Network Programming module for the B.Sc. (Hons) in Information Technology specializing in Cyber Security at SLIIT. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to configure network services, automate tasks using shell scripts, and implement security measures in a virtualized Linux environment.

Features and Implementations
1. Linux Environment Setup
Virtual Machine Installation: Step-by-step guidance on installing VirtualBox and setting up Ubuntu.
Basic Linux Commands: Navigation, file management, and permission handling.
2. Network Configuration
DHCP Server: Installation and configuration to allocate IP addresses dynamically.
DNS Server: Setting up a BIND9 DNS server with forward and reverse zones.
NTP Server: Synchronizing system time across the network.
3. Automation with Shell Scripting
System Reporting Script: Automates daily system reports (date, uptime, memory, and disk usage).
Backup Script: Periodic backups of critical directories.
4. Security Enhancements
Firewall Configuration (iptables): Securing web servers, remote access, and application-specific rules.
SSH Setup: Secure remote administration using SSH.
System Hardening: Best practices for Linux security, including disabling unused services and IP forwarding.
5. Best Practices
Password policies and enforcement.
Regular updates and patch management.
Structured and indented scripting for readability and maintainability.
Prerequisites
Hardware: A system capable of running VirtualBox and multiple virtual machines.
Software:
VirtualBox
Ubuntu (Desktop/Server)
Tools: isc-dhcp-server, bind9, ntp, iptables
